// OPTIONAL non-partial file that imports all of the partial files above, then this file can be imported into a component-level stylesheet. Instead of writing 4 imports for base, exts, mixins and vars, you'll just do: @import '../path/to/styles/index.scss'; now you have included all 4 partials within 1 import

@import './base/base';
@import './exts/extensions';
@import './mixins/mixins';
@import './vars/vars';
